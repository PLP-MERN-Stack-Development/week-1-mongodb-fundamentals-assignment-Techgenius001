# PLP Bookstore- MongoDB Practical Assignment

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates the use of MongoDB for managing a bookstore collection. It covers basic CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

- **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)**: Used to execute all database queries directly from the terminal.
- **MongoDB Compass**: Used to visually inspect the database, collections, and inserted data.
- **VS Code**: Used to write and manage script files (`insert_books.js`, `queries.js`, and `README.md`).
- **Git & GitHub**: Used to version control and submit the assignment repository via GitHub Classroom.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed

I used **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)**, but this will also work with Compass or Atlas.

### 2. Connect to your MongoDB instance

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
